        <ul>
            <li><b>Sprint 00 -</b> To formally complete and accept a project, we had to first draft and finalize a project proposal and product charter document with our client.</li>
            <li><b>Sprint 01 -</b> We were task to create both a context diagram and business event table to show our client. Basically these two outlines the specific needs that our client wants in his website.</li>
            <li><b>Sprint 02 -</b> This is the beginning of what the website should look like. We all made different low-fidelities and got feedback from our client saying that some screen would like really similar and that their format should be the same. Overall, we presented a low-fidelity he is pleased with!</li>
            <li><b>Sprint 03 -</b> Improving our low-fidelities, we then created high-fidelity for a more interactive and better experience for our client to judge. He definitly like what we have done and now we have an outline of what his website was going to look like. </li>
            <li><b>Sprint 04 -</b> A summary of all our current work up until now and a schedule planning for the upcoming sprint and the following semester. </li>
